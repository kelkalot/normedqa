# üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è NorMedQA: Norwegian Medical Question Answering Benchmark & Dataset

This repository provides the configuration for running the NorMedQA benchmark using the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).

## Benchmark Description

NorMedQA is designed to evaluate the medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Norwegian context (Bokm√•l and Nynorsk).

The benchmark consists of 1241 question-and-answer pairs covering various medical fields. The data was collected from publicly available sources containing Norwegian medical examination questions and subsequently checked, cleaned and preprocessed.

## Dataset

The dataset is hosted separately on Zenodo and needs to be downloaded manually.

* **Dataset:** Riegler, M. A. (2025). Norwegian Medical Question Answering Dataset - NorMedQA (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15320038](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15320038)

*Note: The repository includes code to split the original data file into train/test sets.*

## Usage

You can run the benchmark evaluation using the provided Colab notebook or by setting up the environment locally (see notebook and python file).

* **Colab Notebook:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sDYReWYdt-3vYiAibqAohrAqTBD7aJHr?usp=sharing)

The notebook includes steps for installation, data splitting, and running the evaluation command (e.g., for `google/gemma-3-1b-it`).

## Metrics

The example benchmark setup reports the following metrics (these can be extended based on intended use):

* `exact_match`: Percentage of generated answers that exactly match the reference answer.
* `rouge` (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum): Measures overlap between generated and reference answers based on n-grams and longest common subsequences.
